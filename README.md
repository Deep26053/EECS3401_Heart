# Heart Disease Dataset Analysis with Logistic Regression
## Problem Framing:
### Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to explore key indicators associated with heart disease using the Heart Disease dataset obtained from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the year 2022. By applying logistic regression, we aim to identify significant variables influencing the likelihood of heart disease.
### Key Questions:
Which variables have a significant effect on the likelihood of heart disease?
What are the primary factors associated with heart disease risk?
How does class imbalance impact model performance, and how can it be addressed?
What insights can be derived from logistic regression model coefficients?
## Data Exploration and Visualization:
### Data Understanding:
Explored the structure and variables in the dataset.
Identified missing values, outliers, or anomalies.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted summary statistics for key variables, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes status, obesity, physical activity, and alcohol consumption.
Visualised the distribution of variables related to heart disease risk factors.
Examined the trend of heart disease prevalence over the survey years.
Explored the relationship between heart disease and other variables.
### Data Visualisations:
Utilised histograms, bar charts, and pie charts to represent variable distributions.
Created time-series plots to analyse trends in heart disease prevalence.
Implemented heatmaps to explore relationships between variables.
Developed geographical maps to visualise regional variations if applicable.
### Insight Generation:
Identified significant patterns and correlations in the data.
Provided insights into key factors influencing heart disease risk.
Explored the impact of different variables on heart disease prevalence.
### Summaries and Reports:
Generated summaries and reports answering key questions and providing actionable insights.
Discussed the implications of logistic regression model coefficients in predicting heart disease likelihood.
This analysis aims to contribute to the understanding of heart disease risk factors and facilitate the development of preventive healthcare interventions and personalised treatment strategies.
